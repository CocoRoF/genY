"""
Geny Platform Tools — Built-in tools for team collaboration.

The Geny platform is modelled as a virtual company / organization:
  - Sessions = team members / employees (each with a name and role)
  - Rooms    = meeting rooms / group channels
  - Creating a session = hiring / bringing in a new team member
  - Adding to a room   = inviting a colleague to a meeting / channel
  - DM inbox           = private email / direct messages between members

Tool categories:
  - Team management: list members, view profiles, hire new members
  - Room management: list rooms, create rooms, invite members
  - Communication:   post in rooms, send DMs, read messages, check inbox

These tools are auto-loaded by MCPLoader (matches *_tools.py pattern)
and registered as built-in tools under the ``_builtin_tools`` server.

Architecture:
  - All tool operations go through the same singletons used by REST APIs
  - Direct messages use a lightweight file-based inbox per session
  - Room broadcasts re-use the existing ChatConversationStore
  - DMs auto-trigger the recipient session to read and respond
